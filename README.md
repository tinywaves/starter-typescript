# starter-typescript

A simple code template for TypeScript developing.

use:

1. [`tsup`](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) for file compiling.
2. [`tsx`](https://tsx.is/) for file execution and content change monitoring.
3. [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting and linting. And also use my personal [`eslint-config`](https://github.com/tinywaves/eslint-config) for linting rules.
4. Auto GitHub workflows for new version.
5. [`Vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.
